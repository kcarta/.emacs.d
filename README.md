This repo contains my personal Emacs config. It is highly tweaked to my own usage quirks, so this likely won't be useful for anyone outside of referencing how I accomplish specific things. 

I am a relative Emacs noob, so expect to find naive or incorrect approaches in here (leave an Issue if you have input!!!)

My starting point was a literate config written alongside [DistroTube's 'Configuring Emacs' series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1fgypEiQkE&list=PL5--8gKSku15e8lXf7aLICFmAHQVo0KXX), which I have been tweaking incrementally ever since.
